Orginal Vision
Have a bot that can recive and overwatch code, launch the game on a microservice, capture all metadata relating to a match
> player positions, velocity and vector
> ult charge 
> player hero 
> kill feed
    < team focus vector
    < team centroid
    < team average distance
>> sightline, topography, angle, choke 
    << peek
>> Player abilty use timestamp, and land
>> player vision
    << was killer on screen
    << who see []

this bot would need to start the game code, fly though the map, make decisons about how to manipulate the camera and catalog that information.

Requirments for this process
> capture information off screen
> create a 3d 'world model' to navigate
> intract with the program (frame stream?)
> have a compelex set of huristics
> be fault tollerant in terms of its abilty to recover from bad positions

Possible starting place:
Frame stream?
Capturing information from a frame stream will oc be required
Attack red?
Having a bot which only knows how to walk towards and attack bots on Reinhardt would be a simple demonstration of frame stream + control actions, and would expose several current knowlege limitations. 

UI parser?
